    <h3> Errors, exceptions, and warnings</h3>
    <p> Errors occur everytime something goes wrong in a program. there are three kinds of errors:
        system, program and user errors. Pragmmers have little influence upon the system errors, however,
        programmers and user errors should be handled by programmers. They should be able to develop programs that
        that prevent users from making such errors by providing any possible interactions users can perfom.

    </p>
    <p> An exception is an error that produce a return a value that the program can use to handle such errors. Exception
        will also produce a stack trace that can go to the origin where the error comes from. This is sequence
        of method call that can go the biginning of the erros.
    </p>
    <p> A warning is an error that is not enough to cause the program from running or to crash the program
        this should be watched becuase the issue that cause the warning can cause the program to work incorectly
        browsers presennt warning and exception diffeently.</p>

    <h3>The importance of testing and debugging </h3>
    <p> programmers should make sure thier codes are tested and debugged correctly so
        errors can be identified and fixed quickly. it's better to have the codes fail in the developmnt phase
        .exceptions should be caught and dealt with, and code needs to be tested rigorously.</p>

    <h3>Strict mode</h3>
    <p> The sctrict mode produce more exception and warning to make sure the program stands firm to any poor
        writing skills or old or deprecated features. strick mode allow to spot errors early on nad prevent
        them to cause problems later. clariy and speed are then improved. it's strongly recommended and consireded as
        best practice. The syntax of strick mode is: `use strick;` at the beginning of a js file.
    </p>
    <p> Other tools can be use to test the quality of the codes such js lint, es lint and js hint
        modernisr and can i use are some features that enable browser support such features or not.
    </p>

    <h3> Debugging in the browser</h3>
    <p> Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.
        There is a big difference between where a bug appear and where it originates.

    <h3> Throwing exceptions</h3>
    <p> It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement
        When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message.
        This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. but in production,
        this can be harmful, this is the reason why we need to handle the exception.
    </p>

    <h3> Exception handling</h3>
    <p> It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but
        still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ―
        perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.</p>
    </h3>Testing frameworks</h3>
    <p> Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code
        will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.

        A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. </p>
