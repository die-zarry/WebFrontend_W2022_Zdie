        <h2> Notes for week 3</h2>
        <h3> Objects</h3>
        <h5> object literals</h5>
        <p> Object litarals are sets of related values or functions. when the property of the values are functions, we
            identify them as methods
            When the value of a property is function, we call it a method. Objest are mutables which means its value
            can be changed at any time when the program is running. one way to create an object is to use a pair of culy
            braces.we can also use construction to crea=ate object literals. braket and dot notation are used to access
            object
            propertires.The for in loop can be used to loop over an object. we have seen the beaty of
            hasOwnPropert,object.values,
            object.key and onject.entries methods to iterate oven an object. properties and methods and be added or
            changed or removed at any time. </p>
        <h5>JSON </h5>
        <p>json is a lightweight data-storage format used to exchange information betwen web services.
            we have seen the stringify and the parse method. one is the oposite of the other.
            we use the parse method to take a string of data in JSON format to return a JavaScript object.
            and the stringify is used to convert javascript object in to a sctring of json format. </p>
        <h5>Math object </h5>
        <p> Math object has properties and method.All these properties and methods are immutable and unable to be
            changed.
            the properties ares: Math.PI, Math.SQRT2, Math.SQRT1_2, Math.E, Math.LN2, Math.LN10, Math.LOG2E Math.LOG10E
            The method are: math.abs, math.ceil, math.floor, math.round, math.max, math.min. we have seen Some
            power and root, logarithmic and trigonometric method.
        </p>
        <h5>Date object</h5>
        <p> Date objects contain information about dates and times.
            we use a constructor function to create a new date object.</p>
        <h5>RegExp object </h5>
        <p>A regular expression, RegExp, for short is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the
            pattern.
            some of the properties of regexp are: global, ignorecase, multaline.
        </p>
        <h3>The Document Object Model </h3>
        <p> DOM allows is like an interface, in short that helps us play with elements of a web page. we have seen tag,
            attributes and contents inside the tags.
            Legacy DOM Shortcut Methods: body, images, links, anchor, and forms
        </p>
        <h3>Events </h3>
        <p> Events are part of the DOM that serve interaction between the user and the page. Every times
            you click a link, move your mouse or press a key, an event occurs. We have seen the recommended way to
            use event listenner as oposed to inline or older events handlers. We have seen events coordinates to
            find out a click has occured. Mpuse events and keyboard event were also seen with their
            different flavor(keydown, keypress and keyup). The stop event defaul and evetn propagation method
