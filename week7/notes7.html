    <h1> Client and Servers</h1>
    <p>Internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such
        as a web browser, will make a request for a web pages from a server, which processes the request and
        sends back a response to the client.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was at first a clent side language; which means it operated in the browser and could modify web pages
        sent to the browser form the the server.However, with Ajax, JavaScript can send request to the sever.These
        resources requested are usually JSON data, fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page. </p>
    <p> To use Ajax a server is required to respond to those requests or a third party using corss orifin ressourse
        sharing. CORS</p>
    <h1> Ajax</h1>
    <h1> The fetch API</h1>
    <p> API are software that enable applications to communicate. </p>
    <p> The fetch API or the request and response data asynchronously across a network.The fetch() method has only one
        mandatory argument-the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. It returns a promise which will be resolved
        when a responce is recieved from the url. A catch statement is sometimes used to handle any errors occurs a long
        the way</p>
    <h1>The responce Interface</h1>
    <p> When the promise is fullfiled, an object is returned and the fetch API provide a responce interface to deal with
        that. Each object responce has an ok property and method to check if the responce was succesfull.An
        if block can be used to check if the request was successful, and throw an error otherwise.
        Some other property of the respnce obhect are: Headers, url, redirected and type. The methods are: redirect,
        The text() method, the blob() and the json() method </p>
    <h> the Json</h>
    <p> The json responce is among the most common format for AJAX. It converts a json dato into a javascript object.
    </p>
    <p> The different type of request: POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE</p>
    <p> The header interface is use for any additional information such as the file type, cookies and authentification,
        time updated. The headers object has property and methds such has(), get(), set(), append() and </p>

    <h1>the FormData</h1>
    <p>The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using
        Ajax.</p>
