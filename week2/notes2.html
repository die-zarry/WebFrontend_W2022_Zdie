        <h2> Notes for week 2</h2>
        <h3> Arrays</h3>
        <p> We have looked over the arrays. we have seen howw to declare arrays and the properties
            and method attached to arrays- pop, shift and push, unshift, concat for merging, the spread operator. we
            have
            also some other methods such join, slice and splice, sort and include.
            we have alos seen multidimentioanl arrays which is helpful when creating coordidinates values. we have seen
            how to access values in multidimentioanl arrays as to using 2 idices. The different ways of using some data
            structurre as to
            sets and maps were seen. We have seen the if statement and the ternary operator. I have finaly grasp the
            fullpicture of ternary.
            . the different loop structures were alo covered st for, while and do while loop.
            , the different methods asociated with set; how to convert set to arrays, </p>
        <p> we have learned about functions. We have found out the different ways to define function
            -function declaration, function expresstion and arrow function. We have also seen the callback function
            . we need to confess that we do not grasp the full picture of the call back function
            We have seen some other methods such as: map, sort and reduce. We have understand a bit, the main issue is
            when to apply these methods in real life scenarios.
