        <h1>A wrap up of what the BMI App could be</h1>
        <h2>Tell me how to use your application.</h2>
        <p> The app is pretty simple: You will be presented with a main page with some inputs, linked images and
            buttons. The user
            will enter his age, height and weight.Then press press the Calculate BMI button to calculate his/her BMI.
            His/her calculated BMI will then be displayed on his screen.
            The weight is in KG and your height cm as shown in the form. (I wanted to for the user to enter any number
            and the program will have to convert
            them into kg and cm automatically, I also wanted the user to specify their gender and age to be processed
            accordingly. I wanted also to display a specific image in accordance with user BMI whether the user be
            normal, underweight or obese and to suggest the user with some actions as to doing more exercises, the
            number
            calories to enter and out of the body based on his/ner nutrition and also what is necessary for that
            specific body and how to fix it, eating fruits and vegetables or have
            more sleep. In fact, I wanted to help the user structure or improve his/her BMI base on the abnormality
            found. I
            need to confess that some users are under especial conditions and are limited to some actions. I wanted even
            to
            forward them the to some specialist or physicians to help them solve their BMI issue. </p>
        <h2> A list of Itemized CSS features used </h2>
        <p> I have used css grid, css animation and transition. </p>
        <h2> A description of your design process.</h2>

        <p> The has a main page with some links to some other pages. In the main page, we find an image link that links
            to
            local storage. One other image link to some butons that when press on will display the API of some related
            BMI API. </p>

        <h2>Did you alter your app from the original concept? How did you and why?</h2>

        <p>Yes, I wanted to have operating back and next button. I also wanted to display the BMI result with their
            specific image when the BMI result is being displayed.</P>
        <h2> What problems did you have and how did you resolve them? </h2>

        <p> I couldl not find BMI api with images as to cat and dog related ones. Maybe I might have to build a BMI with
            pictures. Some of the food BMI are paid, my credit card is expired I could access them. I want to continue
            to work to this BMI stuff and hopefully build and robust app regarding BMI or a game related to BMI where
            people can play that BMI game and learn more about their body, food- fruits and vegetables, recipe,
            calories,Describe your use of the coding topics from the course. How were they applied?
            I have used bit of javascript to calculate the bmi and fetch them , some css and local storage.
             I also wanted to take away the 10, 11, and 12 number in my list.</p>
